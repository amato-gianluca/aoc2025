# Advent Of Code 2025

This repository contains my Rust solutions for AoC (Advent of Code) 2025.

All of them solve the problems in a few instants on a Linux system equipped with an Intel Core™ i5-13600K and 32 GB of RAM, with the following exceptions:
  * `puzzle10.rs`:
    * Solving part 2 on the real input takes a very long time (more than one hour in the release profile, no idea in the development profile).
  * `puzzle12.rs`:
    * *Example input*: takes a couple of seconds with the release profile, but around one minute with the development profile.
    * *Real input*: takes less than a couple of minutes with the release profile and more than four minutes with the development profile.

## ChatGPT solution

Source files whose name starts with `chat_` are generated by ChatGPT 5.1 Edu using the following prompt:

<blockquote>
  Read the following text and write a Rust program which solves both parts. The program should take its data from the standard input.
</blockquote>

The full text of both parts of each puzzle was then provided, excluding the lines containing the puzzle answers.

All generated code compiles cleanly using the Rust 2024 edition. Most programs correctly solve the problems in a few instants on the same system described above, with the following exceptions:
  * `chat_puzzle9.rs`:
    * *Example input*: produces an incorrect result for part 1 (36 instead of 50). The issue is caused by the formulas used to compute the side lengths of a rectangle, namely `(x2 - x1).abs()` and `(y2 - y1).abs()`, where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of opposite corners. Because the grid is discrete, each side length should include both endpoints, so one must be added to each value.
    * *Real input*: crashes after a couple of minutes with a memory allocation error.
  * `chat_puzzle10.rs`
    * *Example input*: works correctly.
    * *Real input*: crashes immediately with a memory allocation error.
  * `chat_puzzle11.rs`
    * *Example inputs*: work correctly.
    * *Real input*: does not produce any result within 5 minutes from the program start.

The reason for some of these failures is that ChatGPT uses the input example to estimate the amount of work for a brute force attach, concluding that it is a feasible approach even when it is not.

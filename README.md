My Rust solutions for AoC (Advent of Code) 2025.

All of them solve the problems in a few instants in development mode, with the following exceptions:
  * `puzzle10.rs`: takes a very long time in release mode, more than one hour, for solving part 2 of the real input problem;
  * `puzzle12.rs`: takes a couple of minutes in release mode for solving part 2 of the real input problem.

## ChatGPT solution

Source files whose name starts with `chat_` are generated by ChatGPT 5.1 Edu (which should be equivalent to the Plus offering) using the following prompt:

<blockquote>
  Read the following text and write a Rust program which solves both parts. The program should take its data from the standard input.
</blockquote>

Then the entire text of both parts follows, without the lines with the puzzle answers.

All code produced compiles cleanly in Rust 2024 edition. All programs solve the problems in a few instants, with the following exceptions:
  * `chat_puzzle9.rs`:
    * example input: gives a wrong result for part1 (36 instead of 5p);
    * real input: core dumps after after a couple of minutes with a memory allocation error.
  * `chat_puzzle10.rs`
    * example input: works;
    * real input: immediately core dumps with a memory allocation error.
  * `chat_puzzle11.rs`
    * example inputs: works;
    * real input: no results after.

The reason for some of these failures is that ChatGPT uses the input example to estimate the amount of work for a brute force attach, concluding that it is a feasible approach even when it is not.
